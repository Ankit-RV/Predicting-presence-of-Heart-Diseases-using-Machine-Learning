# Predicting presence of Heart Diseases using Machine Learning
*According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, and various diseases. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.

*Machine Learning is used across many spheres around the world. The healthcare industry is no exception. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of Locomotor disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.
